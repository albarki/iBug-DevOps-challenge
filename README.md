DevOps	Challenge
-------------------

1. Follow	this	blog	post	to	dockerize	a	sample	app		
https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/dockerizing-a-ruby-on-rails-application
2. Do	the	same,		but	with	using	kubernetes,		you	can	use	minikube	to	build	a	cluster	on	
your	local	machines	
3. Do	not	use	the	.env	file,	figure	out	another	way	to	pass	the	env	variables	to	the	
container	
4. Document	your	work	in	a	readme	
5. Bonus:	use	configmaps	in	kubernetes	for	the	environment	variables

Deliverables:
-------------

A	github	repo	with	all	the	relevant	work,	compose	files,	kubernetes	files....	Etc
Please	feel	free	to	ask	any	questions.
